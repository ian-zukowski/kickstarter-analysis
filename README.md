# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The data analyzed in this project will show the effectiveness of Kickstarter campaigns as related to several variables.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the effect of distinct characteristics to predict the success of the Kickstarter campaign for the play "Fever".
This was accomplished by looking at the data related to "Launch Date", "Fundraising Goal Amount", and "Backers Count" to predict threshold values that may increase the probability of the campaign achieving its financial goal.
